"The best way to send information is to wrap it up in a person."

(Julius Robert Oppenheimer, 1948)

How do academic talents travel around the world?

Where do researchers go when they change affiliations? And where do they come from?

Which research institutions, regions, or countries are hotspots for scientific expertise in specific research areas?

And which of these institutions are knowledge sinks?

Are there sinks and hotspots that researchers lose or gain disproportionate among researchers?

Welcome to the Complexity Science Hub Vienna “SciFlows”  analytics notebooks. They provide insights that go beyond traditional performance indicators. Academic mobility, as measured by changes in author affiliations, is at the heart of our investigation. We demonstrate that bibliometric data can provide deep insights into policy, researcher mobility, and research entities' attraction strategies, all of which are still understudied aspects of Quantitative Science Studies. Data source: The data was provided by Dimensions.ai. We welcome feedback on our data visualization and our scientific research. Explore the high-granularity mobility of researchers (aggregated) for thousands of publication-producing institutions across the globe.
